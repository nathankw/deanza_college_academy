The 100 most popular baby girl names of 2018 according to https://www.babycenter.com/top-baby-names-2018.htm were
copied into the file girl_baby_names.txt, and similarly for the 100 most popular boy names which were written
to boy_baby_names.txt.

The script make_dist.py was used to generate a list of 1000 baby girl names by sampling randomly 
from the names in the girl_baby_names.txt file. This file can then be used as an exercise to teach 
file IO and practice with dictionaries to find out which names are the most frequent.
