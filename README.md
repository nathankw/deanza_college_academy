The ``tic_tac_toe.py`` script demonstrates how one can do GUI development in Python. This uses the tkinter library to create a fun and educational tic tac toe game, which can be used as a basis for teaching students GUI development, debugging, and contributing to create new or enhancement features. 

## Running the game

Clone this repos, and add it to your PYTHONPATH. Then, run the script:

``python3 tic_tac_toe.py``

A window will pop up for you to interact with. You can either play against the computer, or against another player. 
The computer player is designed to be a very easy opponent - it only picks a random play spot. A good exercise is to allow students to design their own computer player algorithm, and even make a competition out of it.
