# 1. The turtle is in the way in the puzzle. Hide the turtle so that just the
#    puzzle is visible. 
#
# 1. Update the last print statement so that it prints the number of turns instead
#    of the placeholder of "_". Keep track of the number of turns in a new variable
#    called "turns". 
#
# 2. Add a feature that allows the user to solve the puzzle. 
#    Hint: change the input line to be 
#
#        user_letter = input("Choose a letter, or type the word to solve: ")
#
#    Next, you need to add a check to see if the user entered a single letter, 
#    or more than one letter (a word). If a word was entered, then check if that 
#    word equals the game puzzle's word. If they match, then congratulate the 
#    user and end the game.
