Colors

Color picker at https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp

1) What is the RGB value for pink?  And for orange?
2) Write a program that stores the RGB values for the following colors:

  black
  blue
  green
  orange
  pink
  purple
  red
  white
  yellow
  
  The keys should be the RGB numbers. The values should be the human-friendly color names.
  Use a dictionary to store the key and value pairs. You program should list all the color names that
  your program knows about and then ask the user to pick one of them. Then, your program will tell 
  the user the RGB values for that color.
